<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Ranks</h3>
<p>Instead of assigning permissions to every user individually, we have groups of permissions, which can then be assigned to a user as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, in my "admin" rank, I might add permission to ignore claims, and then assign users to the admin rank. This means that they will get all of the permissions from "admin", plus any they have themselves.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Users and groups are able to inherit permissions from each other. For example, by default, all users inherit permissions from the "player" rank. You can setup your own groups an inheritances for your server, and make your own unique
    system.</p>
<p>For example, I might have 3 groups, "player", "admin" and "vip". I want vip to inherit permissions from player, and admin to inherit permissions from from the builtin_op rank.</p>
<h3>Permission</h3>
<p>On your server, there will be a number of features, commands, and functionality which is added to the game. Most of these actions have a permission associated with them, so you can control which users have access to each feature or
    command.</p>
<p>A permission is just a string, and is separated into parts using periods. For example, "ftbu.back.infinite" is the permission to use the /back command infinitely. Obviously we donâ€™t want all users to have access to this, so we only give
    it to some users.</p>
<p>The string that represents a certain permission is also sometimes called a "permission node" or just "node" for short.</p>
<h3>UUID</h3>
<p>Universally unique identifier - every paid Minecraft account has one of those, and it's used to uniquely identify players even when they change their name. E.g. this is the UUID for LatvianModder:</p>
<pre>5afb9a5b207d480e887967bc848f9a8f</pre>
<p>You can use a website like namemc.com to convert from a player's username to their UUID. Note: FTBU uses the short UUID without the dashes (trimmed)!</p>
