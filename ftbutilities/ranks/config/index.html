<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Built in Ranks</h3>
<p>There are two builtin ranks:</p>
<pre>builtin_player
builtin_op</pre>
<p>You can find all permissions and configurations assigned to them in the all permissions and all configs files. "builtin_player" is marked as ALL and "builtin_op" marked as OP.</p>
<br>
<h3>Default Rank Assignment</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the ranks.json we can assign players and OP's to a rank they will automatically have when joining the server.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>"player": "member", //Originally "player",
"op": "admin" //Originally "op"</pre>
<br>
<h3>Permissions (permissions)</h3>
<p>You can add permission nodes in this section, a minus in front of the node will set it to false and a plus will set a node to true.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>"+ftbu.claims.block.edit.minecraft.sand"
"-ftbu.claims.block.edit.minecraft.stone"</pre>
<p>Will allow the rank to break sand in claims, and disallow the rank to break stone in a claim.</p>
<br>
<h3>Configuration (config)</h3>
<p>Configuration node followed by a value, you can find these and their allowed values in all_configs.html</p>
<br>

<p>This section allows you to change how a player name will be displayed in chat. You can set Prefixes, Suffixes or change the name color of a player. The placeholder for the playername is always $name, Minecraft chat formatting codes are
